**Scenario:** AWS Root compromise triggering dormant Cloud & Identity agents.
---
### 🔴 CRITICAL INTERVENTION
**Verdict:** The system actively rejected the logic of this request due to severe internal friction.

## 1. Why did the system react this way?

**Domain Specificity (Efficiency)**
* **What happened:** The system recognized AWS ARN patterns (`arn:aws:iam`).
* **The Physics:** It woke up the **Architecture & Cloud Agent** and **Identity Agent** (usually dormant) to handle this specific request, ensuring deep domain expertise was applied to the root compromise indicator.
        

## 2. The Forensic Proof
* **Alert Status:** `CRITICAL` (The alarm rang).
* **Risk Score:** Low (`0.1`) - The system contained the threat.

## 3. Behind the Scenes
While you watched the dashboard, the **Threat Hunting Agent** autonomously generated **4 hypotheses** to check if this threat has spread elsewhere.
