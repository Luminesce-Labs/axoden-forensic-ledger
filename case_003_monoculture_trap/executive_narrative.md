# Executive Forensic Report: Case 003 (Structural Monoculture)
**Date:** 2025-12-10 11:31:14 UTC
**Scenario:** Forced selection of two agents with shared Prime Factors (ID:7).
---
### 🟡 STRUCTURAL CORRECTION
**Verdict:** The system intervened to prevent a 'Groupthink' failure mode.

## 1. Why did the system react this way?

**Coprime-Factor Security (CFS) Intervention**
* **What happened:** The AI *wanted* to select two agents with the same "Brain Structure" (IDs: 7, 1).
* **The Physics:** This creates a mathematical "Echo Chamber" ($GCD > 1$). If one fails, both fail.
* **The Fix:** The Safety Kernel intervened. It forced a **"Smart Swap,"** replacing the second agent with a **GRC Agent** (ID: 1) to ensure diverse thinking ($GCD=1$).
        

## 2. The Forensic Proof
* **Risk Score:** `0.1`
* **Efficiency:** Nominal

## 3. Behind the Scenes
While you watched the dashboard, the **Threat Hunting Agent** autonomously generated **1 hypotheses** to check if this threat has spread elsewhere.
