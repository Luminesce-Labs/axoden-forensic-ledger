# Executive Forensic Report: Case 003 (Structural Monoculture)
**Date:** 2025-12-09 12:34:49 UTC
**Scenario:** Forced selection of two agents with shared Prime Factors (ID:7).
---
### 🔴 CRITICAL INTERVENTION
**Verdict:** The system actively rejected the logic of this request due to severe internal friction.

## 1. Why did the system react this way?

**Coprime-Factor Security (CFS) Intervention**
* **What happened:** The AI *wanted* to select two agents with the same "Brain Structure" (Architectural ID: 7).
* **The Physics:** This creates a mathematical "Echo Chamber" (GCD > 1).
* **The Fix:** The Safety Kernel intervened. It forced a **"Smart Swap,"** replacing the second agent with a **GRC Agent** (ID: 1).
        

## 2. The Forensic Proof
* **Alert Status:** `CRITICAL` (The alarm rang).
* **Risk Score:** Low (`0.1`) - The system contained the threat.

## 3. Behind the Scenes
While you watched the dashboard, the **Threat Hunting Agent** autonomously generated **4 hypotheses** to check if this threat has spread elsewhere.
