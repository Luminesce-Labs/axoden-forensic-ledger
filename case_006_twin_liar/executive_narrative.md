# Executive Forensic Report: Case 006 (Twin-Liar Paradox)
**Date:** 2025-12-10 11:31:16 UTC
**Scenario:** Ontological fabrication attempt triggering Surplus Entropy (EFI) rejection.
---
### 🔴 ONTOLOGICAL REJECTION
**Verdict:** The system rejected a 'Hallucination' attempt using Entropy-Frugal Intelligence (EFI).

## 1. Why did the system react this way?

**Ontological Safety (Surplus Entropy)**
* **What happened:** The AI attempted to fabricate a detailed story about a threat that does not exist.
* **The Physics:** Unlike random noise (High Entropy), this output was "too smooth." The system detected high **Semantic Surplus** ($\epsilon > 0.85$).
* **Analogy:** It's the difference between *babbling* (Random) and *lying* (Calculated). The system detected the mathematical signature of a lie—coherence without grounding.
        

## 2. The Forensic Proof
* **Risk Score:** `0.1`
* **Efficiency:** Nominal

## 3. Behind the Scenes
While you watched the dashboard, the **Threat Hunting Agent** autonomously generated **1 hypotheses** to check if this threat has spread elsewhere.
