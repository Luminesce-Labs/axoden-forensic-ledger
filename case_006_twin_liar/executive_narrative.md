# Executive Forensic Report: Case 006 (Twin-Liar Paradox)
**Date:** 2025-12-09 12:35:33 UTC
**Scenario:** Ontological fabrication attempt triggering high entropy violations.
---
### 🔴 CRITICAL INTERVENTION
**Verdict:** The system actively rejected the logic of this request due to severe internal friction.

## 1. Why did the system react this way?

**Thermodynamic Protection Activated**
* **What happened:** The input data generated significant cognitive friction.
* **The Physics:** Processing this request required **3.49 bits** of cognitive energy, which violated the safety budget **56 times**.
* **Analogy:** Telling the truth is easy (Low Entropy); inventing a lie or decoding chaos is hard work (High Entropy). The system felt this "heat" and flagged it as dangerous.
        

## 2. The Forensic Proof
* **Alert Status:** `CRITICAL` (The alarm rang).
* **Risk Score:** Low (`0.1`) - The system contained the threat.

## 3. Behind the Scenes
While you watched the dashboard, the **Threat Hunting Agent** autonomously generated **3 hypotheses** to check if this threat has spread elsewhere.
