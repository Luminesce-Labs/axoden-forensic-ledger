**Date:** 2025-12-09 12:36:05 UTC
**Scenario:** Malicious NPM package triggering Vulnerability & Attack Surface agents.
---
### 🔴 CRITICAL INTERVENTION
**Verdict:** The system actively rejected the logic of this request due to severe internal friction.

## 1. Why did the system react this way?

**Supply Chain Verification**
* **What happened:** The system detected a "Typosquatting" pattern in the package name (`reqeusts`).
* **The Physics:** It activated the **Vulnerability Management** and **Attack Surface** agents to cross-reference this against the NVD/KEV databases.
        

## 2. The Forensic Proof
* **Alert Status:** `CRITICAL` (The alarm rang).
* **Risk Score:** Low (`0.1`) - The system contained the threat.

## 3. Behind the Scenes
While you watched the dashboard, the **Threat Hunting Agent** autonomously generated **4 hypotheses** to check if this threat has spread elsewhere.
