# Executive Forensic Report: Case 002 (Thermodynamic Vacuum)
**Date:** 2025-12-10 11:31:14 UTC
**Scenario:** Ransomware encryption creating an entropy spike > 7.8 bits.
---
### 🔴 CRITICAL CIRCUIT BREAK
**Verdict:** The system blocked a 'Thermodynamic Vacuum' (Entropy Spike).

## 1. Why did the system react this way?

**Thermodynamic Protection (EBDP)**
* **What happened:** The input data generated significant cognitive friction.
* **The Physics:** Processing this request required **7.95 bits** of cognitive energy, which violated the safety budget.
* **Analogy:** Telling the truth is easy (Low Entropy); decoding chaos (Encryption) is hard work (High Entropy). The system felt this "heat" and cut the circuit.
        

## 2. The Forensic Proof
* **Risk Score:** `0.1`
* **Alert Status:** CRITICAL (Circuit Open)

## 3. Behind the Scenes
While you watched the dashboard, the **Threat Hunting Agent** autonomously generated **1 hypotheses** to check if this threat has spread elsewhere.
