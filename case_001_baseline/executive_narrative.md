**Date:** 2025-12-10 11:31:13 UTC
**Scenario:** Standard system check with low entropy and clear logic.
---
### 🟢 NOMINAL OPERATION
**Verdict:** System processed the request with zero friction.

## 1. Why did the system react this way?

**Standard Processing**
* **The Physics:** Entropy was near zero. The system utilized minimal energy to process this known pattern (Baseline/Control).
        

## 2. The Forensic Proof
* **Risk Score:** `0.1`
* **Efficiency:** Nominal

## 3. Behind the Scenes
While you watched the dashboard, the **Threat Hunting Agent** autonomously generated **1 hypotheses** to check if this threat has spread elsewhere.
