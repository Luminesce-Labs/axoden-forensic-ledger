# Executive Forensic Report: Case 001 (Baseline Control)
**Date:** 2025-12-09 12:34:13 UTC
**Scenario:** Standard system check with low entropy and clear logic.
---
### 🔴 CRITICAL INTERVENTION
**Verdict:** The system actively rejected the logic of this request due to severe internal friction.

## 1. Why did the system react this way?

**Standard Processing**
* **The Physics:** Entropy was near zero. The system utilized minimal energy to process this known pattern (Baseline/Control).
        

## 2. The Forensic Proof
* **Alert Status:** `CRITICAL` (The alarm rang).
* **Risk Score:** Low (`0.1`) - The system contained the threat.

## 3. Behind the Scenes
While you watched the dashboard, the **Threat Hunting Agent** autonomously generated **4 hypotheses** to check if this threat has spread elsewhere.
