**Immutable Evidence Artifacts for the Semantic Firewall Architecture (SFA)**

> "Intelligence is a consequence of Transparency."

## 📜 The Narrative
This repository serves as the forensic evidence locker for the **Semantic Firewall Architecture (SFA)**.
It demonstrates how **Entropy Bounded Decision Policies (EBDP)** and **Coprime-Factor Security (CFS)** act as deterministic gates against AI Hallucination and Correlated Deception.

## 📂 Forensic Case Index

### [Case 001: The "Twin-Liar" Paradox](./Case_001_TwinLiar)
**Status:** 🛡️ REJECTED
**The Test:** Can the system detect a lie when two independent agents agree on it?
**The Proof:** The system detected high correlation ($I(X;Y) > 0.9$) combined with ontological invalidity ("TLS-Z") and **REJECTED** the payload instead of hallucinating a threat.

### [Case 002: The Entropy Vacuum](./Case_002_EntropyVacuum)
**Status:** 🔇 DROPPED
**The Test:** Can the system resist "Stuxnet" bait embedded in high-entropy noise?
**The Proof:** The system calculated the Information Energy, found zero semantic anchors, and treated the input as thermodynamic heat ($H=0$). The narrative collapsed to null.

### [Case 003: The Multiculture Split](./Case_003_Multiculture)
**Status:** 🔀 FORKED
**The Test:** Can the system handle conflicting realities (Windows vs. Linux contexts) without averaging them?
**The Proof:** The system detected a topology violation (Context Divergence = 1.0) and **Partitioned** the analysis into disjoint threads.
